 * This program takes sales data and determines whether or not fraud has occured using Benford's law.
 * Sales data is passed in as a .csv file and then a chart of the distribution of the leading digit
 * is displayed. Following that, a message is printed that displays whether fraud likely occured. At the
 * end, a .csv file is saved which contains the distribution of leading digits as a percentage, rounded
 * to 1 decimal place.
